# GO_Kattis
This is where i save my Kattis solutions for the GO programming language.

 ## Note

 All of these tasks is solved by a total beginner programmer.
 I've done some Python coding before but these are my first tasks regarding the GO language.

 As such, most, if not all of the codes are probably not the ideal way of doing them.
